1.[Start] Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)

2.[Fitness] Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population

3.[New population] Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete

4.[Selection] Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)

5.[Crossover] With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is the exact copy of parents.

6.[Mutation] With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).

7.[Accepting] Place new offspring in the new population

8.[Replace] Use new generated population for a further run of the algorithm

9.[Test] If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population

10.[Loop] Go to step 2
